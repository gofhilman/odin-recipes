    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is not chicken with fruit rujak sauce, you know. It's called 
        rujak seasoning because it includes many spices besides chilies, 
        including palm sugar that is usually used in fruit rujak sauce. 
        The taste? Of course, it's a blend of spicy, sweet, and savory on 
        your palate! Its appearance is similar to Bali-spiced chicken, but 
        this one is more typically Javanese. Rujak-spiced chicken is 
        usually served fried or grilled.

        <li>2 stalks lemongrass, bruised</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean the chicken pieces that you've cut.</li>
        <li>Marinate the chicken with tamarind water and salt. Coat the 
            chicken evenly, then let it sit for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil, then sauté the prepared spices with the 
            lemongrass. Add the kaffir lime leaves and bay leaves, and 
            sauté until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken to the sauté and stir until evenly coated. 
            Wait a few minutes until the chicken changes color.</li>
        <li>Add the palm sugar, salt, and coconut milk. For a richer 
            taste, wait until the spices are fully absorbed.</li>
