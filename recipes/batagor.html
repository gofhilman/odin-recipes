    <h2 class="recipe-h2">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the tofu into two triangular pieces, then fry them until they're brown. Once they're 
            done, set them aside to cool for a bit.</li>
        <li>Meat Mixture: Blend all the Meat Mixture ingredients (see the recipe) until they're well 
            combined.</li>
        <li>Take a dumpling skin and put 1-2 tsp of the meat mixture onto it. Then, fold the skin just 
            like as shown in the picture.</li>
        <li>Heat up a skillet over medium heat and fry the dumplings until they turn a lovely golden 
            brown. Make sure the meat inside is cooked through.</li>
        <li>If the tofu has cooled down, slit it about 1-2 cm with scissors. Fill it with 1-2 tsp of 
            the meat mixture. Then, coat the outside of the tofu with the meat mixture, just like in 
            the photo.</li>
        <li>Wet Batter: Mix all the Wet Batter ingredients together until thickened.</li>
        <li>Dip each tofu into the Wet Batter, then fry them over medium heat until they're cooked and 
            have a nice golden-brown color.</li>
        <li>Peanut Sauce: Heat 2 tbsp of oil in a pan and saute the raw peanuts, large red chilies, 
            and garlic until they're browned, but be careful not to burn them.</li>
        <li>Blend the sauteed ingredients with the shallots and 450 ml of water. Pour it back into the 
            pan, add an extra 250 ml of water, and then add brown sugar, sweet sauce (kecap manis), 
            lime leaves, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Stir it all together until it starts to boil. If 
            it's not sweet enough for your liking, feel free to add more sweet sauce (kecap manis) or 
            sugar.</li>
        <li>Cut up those dumplings and fried tofu into bite-sized pieces. Pour the peanut sauce all 
            over them. Serve your Batagor with some fried shallots, sweet sauce (kecap manis), chili 
            sauce, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice.</li>
    </ol>
