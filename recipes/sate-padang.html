    <h2 class="recipe-h2">Description</h2>

        <li>4 kaffir lime leaves</li>
        <li>1 tsp tamarind extract</li>
        <li>3 tbsp rice flour</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>0.5 lt beef broth from the boiled beef tongue</li>
        <li>Water for boiling</li>

        <li>15-20 satay skewers</li>
        <li>Lontong/ketupat</li>
        <li>Fried shallots</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="recipe-h2">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the beef tongue thoroughly, and cut it into smaller pieces.</li>
        <li>Put the beef tongue in a cooking pot, and cover with water. Cook over medium high heat until 
            the water boils, and continue cooking for another 5 minutes. Discard the water.</li>
        <li>Take the meat from the pot, and when it is cool enough to handle, trim the outer tough skin 
            using a sharp knife. Discard the skin.</li>
        <li>Put the meat back into the cooking pot, cover it with fresh water, bring to a boil and cook it 
            over medium high heat for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>When done, take out the meat to cool off, strain and reserve 0.5 liters of the broth.</li>
        <li>Cut the meat into 3×3 cm cubes, set aside.</li>
        <li>Blend into a fine paste: garlic, shallots, chillies, ginger, galangal and turmeric.</li>
        <li>Heat the cooking oil in a wok over medium high heat, and sautee the spice paste for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the coriander powder, curry powder, nutmeg, white pepper powder, aniseed, cinnamon stick, star 
            anise, cardamom, cloves, lemongrass, salam leaves, turmeric leaf and kaffir lime leaves. Saute 
            until fragrant, around 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>When done, divide the spice mixture into two (one part will be used to cook the meat, and another 
            part will be used to make the sauce), and leave one part in the wok.</li>
        <li>Add the beef cubes to the wok, add 0.5 liters water and salt to taste,  and cook it for about 1 
            hour over medium heat until the meat is tender and all the liquid has evaporated. Set aside to cool 
            off.</li>
        <li>While waiting for the meat to be done, put the remaining spice paste in a cooking pot, add the 0.5 
            liters of beef broth, tamarind extract and salt to taste. Cook over medium heat for around 20 
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Strain the broth, and let it slightly cool off.</li>
        <li>Dilute the rice flour with a little bit of water and pour it into the broth. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Cook the broth over medium low heat (stir constantly to avoid clumping) until the sauce is 
            thickened. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Thread the meat cubes onto the bamboo skewers, and then grill over hot charcoal or a grill pan 
            briefly (just until the meat is slightly charred).</li>
        <li>Transfer the satay into a serving plate, pour a generous amount of the sauce over it and sprinkle 
            with fried shallots. Serve sate Padang with lontong/ketupat.</li>
    </ol>
